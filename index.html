      <h1>Dear Friends,</h1>
      <p>While you are contemplating your summer plans, and wondering whether to make a trip to our wedding in Trinidad a part of it, we have compiled a list of preliminary information that will help you make the decision.</p>
      <p>
        <ul class="c-list">

        <h2>Getting there <small>(how and how much)</small></h2>
        <p>With getting to Trinidad, the options are fairly limited. Below are the routes that you are most likely to take, with prices checked for August 21st-28th at the time of writing this post. You can, of course, find more creative routes (via Panama, for instance), but the options presented below are really the optimal, in terms of convenience, as well as price.</p>
        <p>When looking for flights, your destination would be POS - Piarco International Airport, Port of Spain</p>
        <h3>From USA</h3>
        <p>From Miami, it’s a 3,5 - 4 hour flight.</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>American Airlines flies twice a day for an average of $400 or below (return)</li>
            <li>Caribbean Airlines offers a flight for about $400</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>From New York, a 5 hour flight.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Caribbean Airlines flies several direct flights a day from JFK, for about $560</li>
          <li>United Airlines from Newark offers a direct for $470-$520 with return to LaGuardia</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>From Canada</h3>
        <p>From Toronto, 5-6 hour nonstop flight with Caribbean Airlines for $560</p>
        <h3>From UK</h3>
        <p>British Airways flies a direct flight from London Gatwick with a stop-over in St Lucia (you will not need to leave the plane), several times a week. Mondays and Tuesdays seem to offer the lowest fares, with the lowest price at £680 for a return.</p>
        <p>There is also an option to fly to Tobago, on Tuesdays and Fridays, for more or less the same fare. These are likely to run out first, seeing that Tobago is more of a tourist destination than Trinidad.</p>
        <p>Please note, that unlike flights from the USA, this particular route seems to sky-rocket in price the closer it gets to the high season, which August undoubtedly is. So you really need to book as far in advance as possible.</p>
        <p>The only other option to check is Virgin Atlantic, which has a flight once a week (Sundays) to Tobago. Prices vary, but generally seem to be more expensive than BA with upwards of £1000 for a return.</p>
        <h3>From Europe</h3>
        <p>From Frankfurt, Germany, Condor Airlines offers a low-cost flight to Tobago, once a week (on Mondays) for about €800.</p>
        <h3>Other</h3>
        <p>If you are traveling from any other destinations, please let us know via email and we will help you figure out the best route possible.</p>

        <h2>Accommodation: make your mind up fast and get the best deal ;)</h2>
        <p>Trinidad is not a tourist destination, so all hotels are business class.</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://trinidad.hyatt.com/en/hotel/home.html" target="_blank">Hyatt</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/trinidad-and-tobago/hilton-trinidad-and-conference-centre-POSHIHH/index.html" target="_blank">Hilton</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/poscy-courtyard-port-of-spain/" target="_blank">Marriott Courtyard</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.thecarltonsavannah.com/" target="_blank">Carlton Savannah</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.kapokhotel.com/" target="_blank">Kapok</a></li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>All offer rooms for rates that most of us will find prohibitive.</p>
        <p>We are looking into renting local accommodation for all our foreign guests at a more reasonable price (USD$20-$40 per person per night, depending on how tight you feel like squeezing). It is important that you let us know if you are coming as soon as possible, so we can secure a good, comfortable and inexpensive accommodation for you.</p>
        <p>Aibnb is sparse in Trinidad, but perhaps in another few months situation might change, so it is always worth a check. The areas to look out for are Maraval, Cascade, St Anns and Westmoorings. Having said that, we urge you to consult with us before you make any bookings, to avoid disappointment. Feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:wedding@saysm.com">wedding@saysm.com</a>, or connect via personal message on Facebook. We promise to answer promptly.</p>
