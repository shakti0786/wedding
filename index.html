        <h1>Dear Friends,</h1>
        <p>While you are contemplating your summer plans, and wondering whether to make a trip to our wedding in Trinidad a part of it, we have compiled a list of preliminary information that will help you make the decision.</p>

        <h2>Getting there: how and how much <i class="twa twa-rocket"></i><i class="twa twa-helicopter"></i><i class="twa twa-boat"></i></h2>
        <p>With getting to Trinidad, the options are fairly limited. Below are the routes that you are most likely to take, with prices checked for August 21st-28th at the time of writing this post. You can, of course, find more creative routes (via Panama, for instance), but the options presented below are really the optimal, in terms of convenience, as well as price.</p>
        <p>When looking for flights, your destination would be POS - Piarco International Airport, Port of Spain</p>
        <h3>From USA</h3>
        <p>From Miami, it’s a 3,5 - 4 hour flight.</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.aa.com/" target="_blank">American Airlines</a> flies twice a day for an average of $400 or below (return)</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.caribbean-airlines.com/" target="_blank">Caribbean Airlines</a> offers a flight for about $400</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>From New York, a 5 hour flight.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://www.caribbean-airlines.com/" target="_blank">Caribbean Airlines</a> flies several direct flights a day from JFK, for about $560</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.united.com/" target="_blank">United Airlines</a> from Newark offers a direct for $470-$520 with return to LaGuardia</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>From Canada</h3>
        <p>From Toronto, 5-6 hour nonstop flight with <a href="http://www.caribbean-airlines.com/" target="_blank">Caribbean Airlines</a> for $560</p>
        <h3>From UK</h3>
        <p><a href="http://www.britishairways.com/" target="_blank">British Airways</a> flies a direct flight from London Gatwick with a stop-over in St Lucia (you will not need to leave the plane), several times a week. Mondays and Tuesdays seem to offer the lowest fares, with the lowest price at £680 for a return.</p>
        <p>There is also an option to fly to Tobago, on Tuesdays and Fridays, for more or less the same fare. These are likely to run out first, seeing that Tobago is more of a tourist destination than Trinidad.</p>
        <p>Please note, that unlike flights from the USA, this particular route seems to sky-rocket in price the closer it gets to the high season, which August undoubtedly is. So you really need to book as far in advance as possible.</p>
        <p>The only other option to check is <a href="http://www.virgin-atlantic.com/" target="_blank">Virgin Atlantic</a>, which has a flight once a week (Sundays) to Tobago. Prices vary, but generally seem to be more expensive than BA with upwards of £1000 for a return.</p>
        <h3>From Europe</h3>
        <p>From Frankfurt, Germany, <a href="https://www.condor.com" target="_blank">Condor Airlines</a> offers a low-cost flight to Tobago, once a week (on Mondays) for about €800.</p>
        <h3>Other</h3>
        <p>If you are traveling from any other destinations, please let us know via email and we will help you figure out the best route possible.</p>

        <h2>Accommodation: make your mind up fast and get the best deal <i class="twa twa-love-hotel"></i><i class="twa twa-wink"></i></h2>
        <p>Trinidad is not a tourist destination, so all hotels are business class.</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://trinidad.hyatt.com/en/hotel/home.html" target="_blank">Hyatt</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/trinidad-and-tobago/hilton-trinidad-and-conference-centre-POSHIHH/index.html" target="_blank">Hilton</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/poscy-courtyard-port-of-spain/" target="_blank">Marriott Courtyard</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.thecarltonsavannah.com/" target="_blank">Carlton Savannah</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.kapokhotel.com/" target="_blank">Kapok</a></li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>All offer rooms for rates that most of us will find prohibitive.</p>
        <p>We are looking into renting local accommodation for all our foreign guests at a more reasonable price (USD$20-$40 per person per night, depending on how tight you feel like squeezing). It is important that you let us know if you are coming as soon as possible, so we can secure a good, comfortable and inexpensive accommodation for you.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target="_blank">Aibnb</a> is sparse in Trinidad, but perhaps in another few months situation might change, so it is always worth a check. The areas to look out for are Maraval, Cascade, St Anns and Westmoorings. Having said that, we urge you to consult with us before you make any bookings, to avoid disappointment. Feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:wedding@saysm.com">wedding@saysm.com</a>, or connect via personal message on Facebook. We promise to answer promptly.</p>

      <section id="getting-around">
        <h2>Getting around: sorry to break it to you, but Uber doesn’t run here <i class="twa twa-oncoming-taxi"></i><i class="twa twa-confused"></i></h2>
        <p>Public transport doesn’t exist in its usual sense in Trinidad, and neither do cabs, or Uber. It is safe to say that without a personal vehicle you are going to have a hard time getting around. But fear not! We will be organising transportation where we can: airport pick ups and drop offs, carpools to the beach, to the wedding, etc. Between ourselves and our local friends, you will not be left stranded. </p>
        <p>However, we do encourage those who want and can afford it (and doesn’t mind a right-hand drive) to consider a group car rental. An average daily rate is around USD$30-$40 / weekly USD$210. <a href="http://www.econocarrentalstt.com/index.html">You can check this website for more details</a>.</p>
      </section><!-- /getting-around -->

      <section id="plans">
        <h2>Plans for the week: why it will all be worth it! <i class="twa twa-palm-tree"></i><i class="twa twa-tropical-drink"></i><i class="twa twa-surfer"></i><i class="twa twa-sunny"></i></h2>
        <p>Depending on your holiday and travel arrangements, you are welcome to arrive at any point during the wedding week, or even earlier if you wish. Keep us posted with your plans, and we will provide you with both pick up and drop off at the airport, and any other personal assistance we can, in order to make your trip-planning as smooth and easy as possible.</p>
        <p>Elena will be in Trinidad for the entire month of August, whilst Nick will be coming the weekend before the wedding. </p>
        <p>We are planning a programme of activities from the 21st to the 27th of August, that will include lots of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">partying and drinking</span> hikes, beach days, dinners, bar crawls, nature reserve visits, and outdoor exercise (for those who don’t want to break the routine - feel free to pack your running shoes). The details will be up on this website closer to the time, so you will be able to check it on a daily basis to see what you’d like to participate in. All activities would, of course, be totally optional and voluntary (apart from the wedding mwahaha).</p>
        <p>Should you want to get exploring on your own, we will also compile a list of things to do and see, with maps and directions, so you would be able to pick and chose the routine that is best for you, to make the most of your stay.</p>

      <section id="plus-ones">
        <h2>Plus one's (or two's or three's) <i class="twa twa-couple"></i><i class="twa twa-heart-eyes"></i></h2>
        <p>Our foreign guests are the most special to us: we understand the undertaking it is for you to come. Which is why we encourage you to make a holiday out of it. We don’t want to put any formal limitations to your posse. If you’d like to bring a friend, a partner, a tinder date, your mom, your children, or all of the above - by all means, do! Everyone will be welcome in Trinidad, and at the wedding. We just need to know in advance. <i class="twa twa-lg twa-wink"></i></p>
      </section><!-- /plus-ones -->

      <section id="climate">
        <h2>Climate &amp; wardrobe: yup, prepare to sweat! <i class="twa twa-sweat-smile"></i></h2>
        <p>Trinidad is a tropical island situated pretty much on the equator. The climate is hot and humid, with average daily temperature of +31C and cooling down to a pleasant +26C at night. The sun rises at 6AM and sets at 6PM every day, so the night falls early and those of you who like a lie-in in the morning might find the daylight slipping away sooner than you’d normally expect in the summer.</p>
        <p>August falls in the rainy season, which is not to be mixed with Asia’s typhoon season: in Trinidad rainy season means only that showers are a regular occurrence, and the island is green and lush, but generally the weather remains good. There will still be plenty sunshine to enjoy, nature gods willing! The rain has the tendency to fall from mid-morning to mid-afternoon, so early mornings and evenings are usually clear. Bring a brolly!</p>
        <p>Clothes-wise, pack light! (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5UlxHsgD58">or smart</a>).
        And we mean it. Flip-flops, a pair of shorts and a t-shirt/vest is all you will end up wearing anyway. Nights out are a good reason to pull some island swag out of your suitcase, but don’t feel pressured: bars and restaurants rarely enforce a dress code, not the ones we like to frequent anyway. If you want to dress up, you won’t feel out of place, as Trinis love to make an effort when they are out. Dresses, heels, jeans, fitted shirts, formal shoes… Not a problem. But if like us, you mostly can't be bothered to dress up, then beach attire can easily double for a night-about-town. (It would still be useful to pack one smart-casual outfit just in case of a more formal outing during the pre-wedding festivities).</p>
        <p>Wedding will be outdoors, so <strong><i>garden chic</i></strong> is your inspiration for the dress-code. Ladies, we strongly advise in favour of flat sandals. Fellas, no suffocating suit &amp; tie combos are mandatory, as long as you still look presentable. We would like everyone to feel comfortable during the ceremony (late afternoon), and on the dance floor throughout the night! </p>
        <p>Bring some comfortable shoes suitable for a hike to a jungle waterfall, and exercise outfit for a fun sweat outdoors. <i class="twa twa-lg twa-smiley"></i></p>
        <p>Ladies, if anyone would be needing services of a hairdresser or a make up artist on the day, feel free to drop Elena a line at <a href="mailto:wedding@saysm.com">wedding@saysm.com</a> and we will gladly organise it for you!</p>

      <section id="tobago">
        <h2>Tobago</h2>
        <p>Tobago is Trinidad’s sister island, and is much more of a Caribbean island you’d know from a holiday brochure. It is tiny, slow, less developed, with beautiful beaches and fishing villages. It is a great place to relax, unwind and truly soak in that island vibe.</p>
        <p>It is only 30 minutes from Port of Spain’s Pirarco airport, and <a href="http://www.caribbean-airlines.com/" target="_blank">Caribbean Airlines</a> can get you there pretty much on an hourly basis for as little as USD$48 return. There is also a more adventurous option of taking an inter-island ferry (beneficial for those who’d like to carry a vehicle across).</p>
        <p>If you’d like to make a 2-3 day trip to Tobago a part of your holiday, let us know! We will provide you with the details of best accommodations, restaurant recommendations, car rentals, etc.</p>
